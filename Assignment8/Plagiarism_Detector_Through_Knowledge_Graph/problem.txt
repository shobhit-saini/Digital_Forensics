Assignment 8 (100 points)
Spring 2020 Similarity Index between two documents indicates the amount of similarity exists in the documents. 
This is a popular tool used in the plagiarism software to detect the amount of text copied from other sources. 
The objective of this assignment is to develop an algorithm based on Machine Learning and graph theory to detect the similarity index between two documents.
The algorithm should take two different documents as inputs and process them to quantify the amount of text similarity in the documents and localize them in the documents. 
Localization can be done by stating the position of the word and length of the match (in words).
The output shall be given in terms of % of matching with respect to the total number of words in the documents. Usually single word matching is not considered as a plagiarism. 
You need to provide an additional input (tolerance) to the system that will decide the number of consecutive words that must match in between the documents to consider 
it as a true positive case. The tolerance value is an integer. Tolerance = 1 means the “single word matching” case and not considered as a plagiarism. 
Overall matching index can be compute after finding out all true positive cases in the whole documents. Words before and after the full stop (.) 
should not be grouped in a single true positive case, i.e. true positive cases must be bounded within a sentence. There are some assumptions and 
key-points as given below:
 Assume the documents are given in plain text format.
 Assume there is no graphical object in the document.
 Try to apply learning techniques instead of simply applying brute force searching for finding the true positive cases.
 A few related papers are attached for your reference. Understand these algorithms and write your own algorithm.
 Submission should include the source file, a documentation on the algorithm (2 pages), and a readme file to execute the code.
